# Summary

Data is key to advancing robotic perception, navigation, locomotion, and reasoning. However, managing diverse robotic
datasets presents unique challenges, including scalability, quality assurance, and seamless integration into diverse
workflows. To address this gap, we introduce Kleinkram, a free and open-source data management system tailored for
robotics research. Kleinkram enables efficient storage, indexing, and sharing of datasets, from small experiments to
large-scale collections. It supports essential workflows like validation, curation, and benchmarking via customizable
compute actions. Designed with a user-friendly web interface, CLI integration, and scalable deployment options,
Kleinkram empowers researchers to streamline data management and accelerate robotics innovation.

# Statement of need

To render robotic data useful for research, it is essential to store, organize, and index the data in a way that makes
it easily searchable and shareable. While large corporations have developed internal tools, the broader robotics
community often relies on fragmented solutions. Current solutions typically fall into three categories, none of which
fully satisfy academic research needs. (1) Commercial SaaS platforms (e.g., Foxglove, Roboto AI) offer excellent
indexing and visualisations but are often closed-source and cost-prohibitive for academia. (2) Cloud-native reference
architectures (e.g., AWS ADDF, Azure DataOps) provide scalability but require complex, vendor-locked infrastructure
setups that are overkill for single labs. Finally, (3) legacy open-source tools (e.g., Marv Robotics) or raw storage
(S3, Google Drive) either lack modern CI/CD integration or offer no content-based indexing, forcing researchers to
manually download large bags for inspection. Thus, a gap remains for an openly available, ready-to-use, and
easy-to-deploy solution for the robotics research community. Additionally, features such as data verification
and the ability to perform tailored compute jobs on newly generated datasets are highly desirable, as they facilitate
benchmarking, reproducibility and algorithmic development.

To address these challenges, we introduce **Kleinkram**, a self-hosted web service designed for scalable and
efficient data management. Unlike traditional cloud storage, Kleinkram natively integrates compute capabilities,
automates data transfer, and eliminates the tedious manual effort typically associated with data management workflows.
By categorizing and structuring data around common robotics use cases, Kleinkram facilitates the creation of large,
diverse datasets that can be easily shared and reused across multiple projects. Its intuitive web interface ensures
accessibility, while a command-line interface (CLI) enables seamless integration into automated pipelines and headless
systems. Kleinkram supports widely adopted standards, building on ROS1 and ROS2 message definitions, and offers native
compatibility with ROSbag and MCAP data formats.

# Data Structure

Kleinkram is designed around the typical data generation process in mobile robotics, assuming data is collected and
stored primarily in ROS1/ROS2-compatible ROSbag or MCAP file formats. Once data recording for an experiment is complete,
these files can be efficiently uploaded and ingested into the Kleinkram system for centralised storage, indexing, and
subsequent post-processing. It is important to note that the current version of Kleinkram focuses on post-recording and
data management. It does not support real-time data streaming or processing on the fly.

To provide structure and facilitate organization and retrieval, Kleinkram requires data to be organized according to a
strict three-layer hierarchy: Projects, Missions, and Files. Each layer maintains a one-to-many relationship with the
layer below it. While users have flexibility in how they map their specific activities to this structure, the intended
model is that a Project represents a distinct research project, which requires data storage. A Mission corresponds to a
single, self-contained experiment or data collection run conducted within that project, and it contains all the
individual data Files (like ROSbag or MCAP files) recorded during that specific deployment. This structured approach
aids in navigating, managing, and understanding large volumes of experimental data.

# System Architecture

Kleinkram's system architecture is modular, comprising several interacting microservices.

- **Python Client Library and CLI**
  Provides programmatic access to Kleinkram's functionalities, enabling efficient data transfer operations (upload,
  download) directly from Python scripts or the command line. This allows seamless integration into robotic workflows
  and automated data pipelines running on robots or workstations, removing the need for manual browser interaction for
  data transfer.

    The CLI is built using the typer library, sharing a core Python codebase with the client library.

- **Web interface**
  Serves as the primary graphical user interface for users to interact with Kleinkram. It allows browsing,
  managing, and structuring files and their metadata.

    It is implemented as a single-page application using the Vue3 framework and the Quasar component library.

- **Backend API**
  Acts as the central communication layer between the client applications (web UI and Python client/CLI) and the data
  storage and processing components. It handles authentication, data indexing, metadata management, and schedules
  background tasks.

    The backend is implemented using the NestJS framework and utilises a PostgreSQL database for storing all metadata
    related to projects, missions, files, users, and actions.

- **Data Store**
  The raw robotic data files (ROSbags, MCAPs) are stored on an S3-compatible object storage backend. This provides
  scalability and flexibility. Users can easily deploy and manage their own storage using self-hosted solutions like
  S3-compatible storage (e.g. SeaweedFS), or utilise public cloud S3 services. Kleinkram interacts with the data store via the S3 API.

- **Action Runner**
  This component enables the execution of customisable data processing and analysis tasks directly on the data stored
  within Kleinkram. Users can define "Actions" (e.g., validate data integrity, extract sensor metadata, generate preview
  visualisations, convert formats, run benchmarking scripts).

    These actions are packaged as Docker containers. The action runner orchestrates the execution of these containers,
    providing them access to the necessary data from the data store using the client library or CLI.

- **Observability**
  (Optional) Monitoring and logging system performance, resource usage, and task execution status are crucial for
  managing a scalable data system. Integration with observability tools, such as the Grafana Stack (Loki for logs,
  Prometheus for metrics, Tempo for traces, Grafana for dashboards) can provide insights into the system's health and
  the progress of the data processing task.

# Usecase

Kleinkram has been used internally at the Robotic Systems Lab at ETH Zurich over the past year. During this time, it has
stored over 20 TB of data collected from various robotic systems, effectively replacing the lab’s previous reliance on
Google Drive for data storage. The largest project supported by Kleinkram was the **GrandTour dataset** [@frey25boxi],
in which our legged robot **ANYmal** [@hutter16anymal], equipped with **Boxi** [@frey25boxi], a multi-sensor payload,
was deployed across various locations in Switzerland.

Following each data collection mission, raw data — recorded in the form of ROSbags and MCAP files — was uploaded
directly to Kleinkram via its command-line interface (CLI). The intuitive Docker-based action integration allowed us to
easily define and execute data verification tests. These include, for example, checks to ensure that all sensor streams
were recorded at the expected frequencies and correct time synchronization was established during the distributed
recordings, as well as common sense checking for validity of data (e.g. images are not black or the IMUs measure the
gravity vector).

Beyond data verification, Kleinkram enabled us to run full SLAM pipelines retrospectively, automatically producing
standard Absolute and Relative Trajectory Error (ATE/RTE) metrics. This compute integration was critical for
development, benchmarking, and evaluation.

Equally important was Kleinkram’s user-friendly CLI, which provided quick access to summary statistics such as dataset
counts, durations, and other key metrics — many of which were directly used in associated publications. Given that for
our use case, data has to be mainly accessed within the ETH network infrastructure; datasets can be pulled on demand and
deleted afterwards, fully utilising the fast on-premise interconnect infrastructure without relying on external servers.

Throughout the project, Kleinkram also enforced metadata submission during upload. Users were required to include a YAML
file describing the mission, which captured essential information such as the robot operator, specific hardware
configuration, location, and links to related resources (e.g., associated Google Drive folders for images). This
structured metadata was essential for organizing and retrieving data at scale.
