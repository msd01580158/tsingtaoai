## The Problem: Your Robot Data Is Slowing Down Your Models

Your algorithm team burns weekends tuning hyperparameters. Your data team burns weekends scrubbing episodes.
More often than not, the bottleneck isn't the algorithm — it's the data.

**01 · Data is buried in file shares**
Thousands of files, and nobody can say which ones are actually trainable. Organizing by *file* is fundamentally at odds with what a model needs, which is *episodes*.

**02 · Bad data slips into the training set**
Failed grasps, idle spinning, collision jitter, dropped objects — these invalid trials can only be found by a human playing back every episode. Meanwhile, they are quietly poisoning your model.

**03 · Timestamps don't line up**
Cameras at 30 Hz, joints at 500 Hz, plus oscillator drift and network latency. Every channel keeps its own time. The model learns causal relationships that were never true.

**04 · Format conversion is manual labor**
LeRobot, RLDS, HDF5, Zarr — five teams, five formats. One-off conversion scripts get rewritten over and over, and still crash halfway through a training run.

**05 · Annotation cost eats the budget**
Purely manual cleaning and labeling means standards drift, and costs explode the moment you scale. Small and mid-sized teams simply cannot absorb it.

**06 · When something breaks, you can only guess**
The model underperforms — is it the algorithm or the data? Without visualization or reports, you are left with trial and error.

## The Answer: Let the Platform Decide Whether Data Is Usable

embodatahub is a **data engineering foundation for embodied AI**. It takes the data-governance work scattered across file shares, ad-hoc scripts, and tribal knowledge, and pulls it into a single standardized, reproducible, auditable automated pipeline.

**See it.** Multi-view video, joint curves, gripper open/close, and 3D trajectories replayed in sync — what your data looks like, at a glance.

**Filter it precisely.** Seven quality filters plus VLM semantic judgment score and grade every episode automatically. Bad data stops before it reaches training.

**Export it.** Five mainstream training formats convert bidirectionally. Export and go — no more one-off compatibility scripts.

> Data engineering should not be an algorithm team's side project. Hand it to the platform, and let your algorithm engineers get back to algorithms.

## Core Capability 01 — Seven Quality Filters, a Full Health Check

One run, seven dimensions checked in parallel. Every episode receives a weighted composite score.

**01 · Visual Quality**
Laplacian variance for blur, pixel-mean checks for over/under-exposure, inter-frame MSE for frozen frames — with evidence frames and timeline visualization.

**02 · Sudden-Change Detection**
Velocity, acceleration, and jerk computed after median filtering and Savitzky-Golay smoothing, with median + MAD robust statistics to surface anomalous jumps.

**03 · Temporal Synchronization**
Validates frame-interval deviation against nominal fps, actual-vs-nominal duration, and the start/end offset between video streams and the data stream.

**04 · Extreme-Value Detection**
Physical bounds established from dataset-wide 1% / 99% quantiles and IQR, with automatic exemption for legitimate behaviors such as gripper saturation.

**05 · Kinematic Consistency**
Loads the URDF model and uses Pinocchio forward kinematics to recompute end-effector poses, verifying that joint states and recorded end-effector poses are physically self-consistent.

**06 · Orientation Alignment**
Aligns position and orientation data through a rotation-correction matrix, removing systematic bias introduced by differing coordinate frames.

**07 · Metadata Completeness**
Six health checks: task description, camera naming conventions, resolution consistency, multi-view coverage, action fields, and episode integrity.

### Scoring and Decision

| Verdict | Threshold | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Passed** | score ≥ 0.8 | Meets quality bar; directly usable for training |
| **Review** | 0.6 ≤ score < 0.8 | Questionable; requires human judgment |
| **Excluded** | score < 0.6 | Critical defects; should be removed from the training set |

---

## Core Capability 02 — Bringing a Large Model into the QC Pipeline

*What numerical checks cannot catch, hand to a vision-language model.*

Numerical detection can find anomalies in curves, but it cannot read what is happening in a frame. Was the robot *placing a block into a box*, or just *waving its arm in circles*? That requires something that can actually understand the image.

embodatahub integrates VLMs into the QC loop: it automatically extracts key frames from each episode, sends them to a vision-language model to judge task success, and returns both a confidence score and a rationale. Failed grasps, dropped objects, incomplete motions — nothing slips through.

**Three integration paths supported**

- **OpenAI-compatible endpoints** — including self-hosted inference services
- **Google Gemini** — `gemini-2.5-flash`
- **Local inference** — data never leaves the intranet

When the VLM judges an episode as failed, the system automatically upgrades its status from *Passed* to *Review*. Better one extra human confirmation than one bad episode slipping through.

**Tunable sampling** — extract 1–12 frames per episode to trade cost against precision.
**Custom prompts** — the evaluation prompt is editable, with a `{task}` placeholder auto-filled from the task description.
**Adjustable weighting** — VLM results carry an independently configurable weight, fused with the numerical filters.

## Core Capability 03 — Five Formats in Free Flow, Export to Train

**Import**

| Format | Description |
|---|---|
| **LeRobot v3** | HuggingFace community standard |
| **ACT HDF5** | ALOHA and other dual-arm manipulation datasets |
| **robomimic HDF5** | robomimic framework format |
| **UMI Zarr** | Universal Manipulation Interface format |

**Export**

| Format | Description |
|---|---|
| **LeRobot v3 / v2.1** | Community standard, either version |
| **ACT HDF5** | Directly usable for dual-arm manipulation training |
| **robomimic HDF5** | Single-file delivery |
| **UMI Zarr** | Directory or archive |

**Export scope and artifacts**

- **Selective** — checked items / passed only / review only / excluded only / all indexed
- **Conversion report** — `conversion_report.json` records field mappings and metadata completeness
- **Human override** — manual decisions are preserved above automatic scores, and take precedence

---

## Core Capability 04 — QC You Can See, Problems With Nowhere to Hide

**Rerun 3D Replay**
Select a suspect episode and generate a replay file in one click: the end-effector's 3D trajectory, per-joint position and velocity curves, gripper open/close state, and multi-camera video aligned on a shared timeline.

**Cleaning Report Dashboard**
Total episodes, total frames, total duration, frame rate, and composite score in a single overview. A quality-distribution histogram is color-coded by passed / review / excluded — anomalies are obvious at a glance.

**Signal Curves and Duration Distribution**
Interactive SVG line charts show gripper dimensions over time; episode duration distributions come with a mean reference line, so abnormally short or long segments surface on their own.

**Evidence Frames and Timeline**
Every finding ships with a representative evidence frame and a timeline position. Conclusions are backed by evidence — no more arguing from intuition.

---

## Core Capability 05 — Local-First: Compliance Before Scale

**Local-first architecture.** The QC workbench runs on *your* machine. Datasets stay on your own disks and are never uploaded to the cloud. Import, inspection, replay, and export all complete locally — teams with data-privacy and compliance requirements don't have to choose between efficiency and confidentiality.

**Engineering details we also got right**

- **Source data is read-only.** The platform never modifies your original datasets. Cleaning state, replay recordings, exports, and reports are written to a separate artifact directory — always traceable, always cleanable.
- **Local inference optional.** VLM evaluation can connect to a local inference service, so sensitive imagery never leaves the intranet while still benefiting from large-model semantic QC.
- **Fully self-hostable.** Containerized one-command deployment, supporting private cloud and on-premises bare metal. It runs completely without any external cloud service.

> The raw data your robots collect is often your most sensitive — and most valuable — asset. It should not have to leave your data center just to get a quality check.

## Core Capability 06 — Automated Pipelines That Pull People Out of Repetitive Work

**File ingestion** → upload triggers an event
**Task enqueue** → asynchronous scheduling with priority management
**Worker execution** → online registration, status reported back
**Automatic processing** → parsing / conversion / content extraction
**Result write-back** → metadata updated, status synchronized

**Task templates out of the box.** Data validation, metadata extraction, BAG→MCAP conversion, visual SLAM, and point-cloud segmentation are built in as templates — no need to write from scratch.

**Online worker management.** Compute nodes auto-register and report heartbeats, with live online status. A node going down is detected promptly, so scheduling decisions rest on real information.

**Seamless handoff from upload to QC.** Once a file lands, its metadata is parsed and it is registered in the index, flowing straight into the QC pipeline's candidate queue with no manual shuttling.

**One-command deployment.** The full service stack comes up through a single unified startup script — frontend, backend API, QC workbench, 3D visualization, and task queue all in place, with no component-by-component manual startup.

---

## Workflow: One Pipeline, A Dataset's Entire Life

```
01 Collect      →  02 Ingest   →  03 QC
   Teleop rig /      Files land in     Seven filters +
   cart / robot      object storage,   VLM auto-score
   multimodal        metadata          and grade
   recording         registered

04 Review       →  05 Export   →  06 Train
   3D replay +       Five formats      Connect to leading
   report review,    convert in one    training frameworks
   human overrides   click, with a     and simulation
   auto verdicts     conversion report environments
```

From a raw recording file to a dataset you can feed straight into a policy network — all within one platform. No more crossing tools, scripts, and handoffs between people.

**A glimpse of a typical scenario.** A 10-minute dual-arm grasping recording lands in the platform. The system automatically segments it into multiple independent manipulation episodes, sends aligned key frames to a vision-language model to generate action descriptions, flags the first failed episode as *grasp failure*, and gives the remaining successful episodes high ratings. The engineer only needs to confirm in the browser — then pick a format and export.

---

## Platform: Not Just a QC Tool, a Complete Data Platform

**Project and data organization** — Manage robot data in a project / mission / file structure, with tagging, classification, and metadata extension. Data assets stay clearly discoverable.

**Multi-format ingestion** — Native support for ROS bag, MCAP, ZED SVO2, and other common robot capture formats, preserving original semantics without lossy re-encoding.

**Permissions and access control** — User groups and role management with resource-level fine-grained access control, balancing team collaboration against data isolation.

**Open APIs and keys** — An API-key system and open interfaces let external systems integrate programmatically, fitting into your existing R&D workflow.

**Global data search** — Unified browsing and search across projects, missions, files, and metadata. Finding data no longer means digging through directories.

**Bilingual interface** — Chinese / English switching, with preferences persisted locally. Collaboration across domestic and international teams is friction-free.

> Tools solve point problems. Platforms solve collaboration problems. embodatahub's goal is to let an entire team work around one shared, trustworthy body of data.

## Use Cases

**1 · Embodied AI startups** — Small algorithm teams, fast-growing data. They need a data pipeline they can adopt immediately so limited headcount stays on the model itself.

**2 · Universities and research labs** — Sensitive data, constrained budgets. They need local deployment and disciplined management to support long-running research and paper reproduction.

**3 · Autonomous driving teams** — Enormous multi-sensor time-series volumes requiring temporal alignment of point clouds and images, calibration-data management, and standard-format export.

**4 · Industrial robotics manufacturers** — Production-line operational data and failure samples needing classification and archival for anomaly detection and predictive-maintenance model training.

**5 · Data collection and annotation service providers** — Delivery quality is the core competitive edge. They need automated QC to replace manual first-pass screening, raising throughput and standardizing delivery.

**6 · Humanoid robot R&D teams** — High-frequency multimodal data, multi-view video, and proprioceptive state coexisting, with demanding requirements on time-synchronization precision and visual verification.
