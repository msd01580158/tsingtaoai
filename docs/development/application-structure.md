# Application Structure

This page describes the structure of the application and how it is organized.

## Service Overview

The application is composed of multiple Docker containers (services), categorized into two primary groups:

- [**core containers**](#core-containers): responsible for running the application
- [**helper** containers](#helper-containers): responsible for monitoring, logging, and documentation.

::: tip Application Structure
The application code is stored inside a monorepo.

Each service is responsible for a specific part of the application and is bundled into a Docker container. The services
are orchestrated by [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

### Core Containers

The operational containers are again split into publicly accessible and non-publicly accessible containers.

#### Publicly Accessible

- [frontend](./application-structure/frontend.md) - the web application written using Vue3 and Quasar
- [api-server](./application-structure/api-server.md) - the backend application written using NestJS
- [seaweedfs](application-structure/infrastructure.md#seaweedfs-object-storage) - the file storage

#### Private Network (Not Publicly Accessible)

- [queue-processor](./application-structure/queue-processor.md) - The service worker processing the queues
- [postgres](application-structure/database-schema.md) - The Postres database
- [redis](application-structure/infrastructure.md#redis-queue-cache) - Database to manage the Queue
- `action containers` - custom containers scheduled by the `queue-processor` to perform user specific actions

## Helper Containers:

- [docs](application-structure/infrastructure.md#docs-service) - this documentation, built using VitePress
- [prometheus](application-structure/infrastructure.md#prometheus) - monitoring (for time series data)
- [tempo](application-structure/infrastructure.md#tempo) - tracing
- [loki](application-structure/infrastructure.md#loki) - logging
- [grafana](application-structure/infrastructure.md#grafana) - visualization of the monitoring dat, logs, and traces

## Git Workflow

We use three designated branches `main`, `dev` and `staging`. To submit new code open a pull request to `staging`. Once enough features are present, we merge `staging` into `dev`. This will trigger our CI/CD pipeline and update the dev deployment. When we are happy with the stability of the dev deployment we merge into `main`.
