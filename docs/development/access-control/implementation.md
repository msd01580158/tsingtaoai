# Implementation

Currently, two methods of authentication are supported: Google and Api Key.
Every regular user should authenticate using Google. Api keys are only used for actions.

## Google Authentication

We use the standard JWT auth flow.
The user logs in to google, which validates the login upon which the backend issues a JWT.

Within the JWT is only the user UUID.
Upon each request, the backend checks the JWT and retrieves the user from the database.
Using this User, using guards, each endpoint validates whether the user has the required rights to access the endpoint.

Common guards are:

- @LoggedIn() - Checks if the user is logged in
- @AdminOnly() - Checks if the user is an admin
- @UserOnly() - Checks if the user is a regular user and not an Api key
- @CanReadProject() - Checks if the user has read rights to the project
- ...

Endpoints that list data, like /oldProject/filtered are often guarded by @UserOnly() and
handle the filtering of the data based on the user rights internally. They will only return the data the user has access to.
For this, the helper function [`addAccessConstraints`](/development/access-control/addAccessConstraints) is used.

## Api Key Authentication

Api keys are currently only used for actions. An Api key grants access in the name of the user that created the key / action.
An Api key has a:

- User - Whom it represents
- Mission - For which it grants access
- Action - In which it is used
- Rights - The rights it grants

As an Api key inherits its rights from the user, on key creation, the rights it has are at maximum the rights of the user on the mission.
Api keys have no rights on projects, only on missions. Thus many listing operations like listing projects and missions are not allowed for Api keys (@UserOnly() guard).

In the middleware (backend/src/UserResolverMiddleware.ts), before the JWT is checked & resolved, the Api key is checked. If an Api key is present,
the user is resolved to the user the key represents. Written into the request object is `req.user = {user: User, apiKey: ApiKey}`.

Each guard is responsible for detecting whether an Api key is present and if so, whether the key grants the required rights.

Files or other entities that are created with an Api key have as the creator the user the key represents.
