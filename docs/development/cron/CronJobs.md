# Cron Jobs

Cron jobs are recurring tasks used for database cleanup, synchronization, and system maintenance.

Most jobs run on the Queue Consumer service. Because this service can have multiple replicas, any job running there must
use Redlock to ensure it only runs on one instance at a time. Jobs on the Backend run as a single instance and do not
require a lock.
