## Structure

Within the `frontend` directory, at the root level are the key configuration files for the frontend application.
The `src` directory contains the source code for the application. The `public` directory contains the static files for
the application

### Configuration Files

- `package.json` - The package.json file contains the dependencies and scripts for the application.
- `quasar.conf.js` - The Quasar configuration file contains the configuration for the Quasar Framework.
- `tsconfig.json` - The TypeScript configuration file contains the configuration for the TypeScript compiler.
- `Dockefile` - The Dockerfile contains the instructions to build the Docker image for the application.
- `dev.Dockerfile` - The dev.Dockerfile contains the instructions to build the Docker image for the application in
  development mode.
- `.env` - The .env file contains the environment variables for the application.
- and some less important files

### Source Code

- `api` - The configuration of the API with [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- `assets` - The assets directory contains the images, fonts, and styles for the application.

## Development

Use the eslinter and prettier to format the code. The code should be formatted before committing. The code should be
linted before pushing. The code should be tested before merging.
