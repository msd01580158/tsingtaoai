# Queue Processor

The Queue Processor is a NodeJS application. It reads from the Redis queue and processes the tasks. The tasks are
scheduled by the API. The queue processor is a separate service that processes jobs from the queue. It is implemented in TypeScript and uses the `bullmq` library.

The Queue Processor also uses NestJS & TypeORM. But with `@nestjs/bull` for Queuing. The Documentation can be
found [here](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/queues).

As it connects directly to the Postres Database it needs to use the same schema. Thus the entities, enums and
environment variables are in the `common` folder.

## Structure

In `src/entities` are the entities. In `src/helper` are helper function for Google Drive handling and S3 handling.

In `src/files/fileQueueProcessor.provider.ts` is the logic for Bag -> MCap conversion.
In `src/actions/fileQueueProcessor.provider.ts` is the logic for the actions.
